# AI-assisted medical case summary in orthodontics final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

In Finland, it is estimated that more than 20,000 new orthodontic patients a year on the public side. Orthodontic treatment usually lasts 1-6 years, including multiple visits to clinic.
The epicrisis is the final summary of the treatment done and takes quite a lot of time to write, as the necessary information is sought from the records over several years.
Using AI methods would speed up the writing process.


## Background

With AI methods, it would be possible to find relevant points in the records of patient visits about the course of treatment. Working time of dentists doing orthodontics (mainly the public side)
would be spared for other tasks.

## Problems
* problem 1 Record when the initial examination was, diagnosis and treatment plan
* problem 2 Record which appliance has been in turn and for how long it has been in use
(usually several different appliances in a row. E.g. removable active plate, headgear, fixed appliances, retention plate)
* problem 3 Record when the final examination has taken place and the outcome of the treatment


## How is it used?

Information about the visit, its content and, in addition, the medical action codes are recorded for each treatment visit. The Initial Inspection and the Final Inspection come separately
forms (or sections) in the system. The recorded medical action codes could be used to search for visits where essentials for the epicrisis have occurred (e.g. when a new appliance come to use 
or fixed appliances are made ). This would happen in the same way as Bayer´s classifiers. Natural Language Processing would be used to extract the names of the orthodontic appliances
and also to get an information on initial and final inspections. The most important thing would be to find out from a large amount of material those visits, when the new instrument came into use and the old one completed. In addition , of course, pick up the names of those orthodontic appliance.
The program would be used by dentist doing orthodontics and would be available to fit existing electronic patient record systems (there are different systems in use, but the medical action codes
are the same).




## Challenges

Since I don’t master coding, this project is just on a thought level. Nor do I know whether the problem is such that its solution would be economically viable for the municipalities.
If the new program were expensive and difficult to get to work with existing patient record systems, no funding would certainly be found. In addition, some of the patient record may now be located in the older
systems than newer data. Therefore, the medical action codes would be the starting point, they have not changed.

## What next?

Maybe the creators of LifeCare , Appot , Aster or similar electronic patient record systems could be interested in the idea ...
